Scientific Calculator.
This is a simple scientific calculator program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, and unit conversions. It is written in C++ programming language and uses the standard input and output library.

Usage.
To use this calculator, simply compile and run the program. Upon running, the user will be presented with a menu with the following options:

Basic arithmetic operations
Trigonometric functions
Unit converter
Programming functions
Exit

Basic Arithmetic Operations.
The basic arithmetic operations option allows the user to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers. The user is prompted to enter the two numbers and the operator. The program then performs the operation and displays the result.

Trigonometric Functions.
The trigonometric functions option allows the user to find the sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle entered in degrees. The program uses the sin(), cos(), and tan() functions from the cmath library to perform the calculations.

Unit Converter.
The unit converter option allows the user to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures, and between kilometers and miles distances. The user is prompted to select the conversion type and enter the value to be converted. The program then performs the conversion and displays the result.

Programming Functions.
This option is not yet implemented and will be added in future updates.
